Some of my favorite music shows, like "Just a Blip" (by my mate Glenn) are on Mixcloud, but I have been annoyed that I can only stream through Mixcloud's website or mobile app. I would prefer to listen on my podcast app of preference and download them so that I can still listen when I don't have a network connection. 

This is my answer to that annoyance. These (shell) scripts download "Just A Blip" show from Mixcloud, upload the audio files to the Internet Archive and generate an RSS podcast file which gets uploaded right here. It is now free from the walled garden of Mixcloud, and is published to multiple podcast platforms allover the web.

"Just a Blip" links: [Feedburner](http://feeds.feedburner.com/just-a-blip) 路 [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/DublinDigitalRadio/playlists/just-a-blip) 路 [DDR](https://listen.dublindigitalradio.com/resident/just-a-blip) 路 [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@abmc?&and[]=subject%3A%22justablip%22) 路 [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/just-a-blip/id1565531309)
